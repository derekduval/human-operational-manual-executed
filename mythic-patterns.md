# FIELD NOTES: Myths as Metaphors for Loop Resistance

> “The ancients wrote what they couldn’t diagnose.  
> We write it now in code, but it’s the same recursion.”

---

## David vs. Goliath  
**Loop Pattern:** Asymmetric feedback correction  
- **Goliath** = The entrenched, oversized system (bureaucracy, culture, ego)  
- **David** = Localized intelligence + precise input (calibrated resistance)  
- **Stone** = Pattern-breaking signal  
**Lesson:** Size ≠ stability. A focused loop can disrupt a bloated one.

---

## Sisyphus  
**Loop Pattern:** Infinite retry without memory override  
- **Sisyphus** = Consciousness aware of the loop  
- **The boulder** = Recurring challenge without system exit  
**Lesson:** It’s not the loop that’s hell—it’s the awareness without agency.

---

## Prometheus  
**Loop Pattern:** Knowledge as destabilizing input  
- **Fire** = Conscious recursive insight  
- **Gods** = Closed system resisting mutation  
**Lesson:** Knowledge doesn’t free you—it marks you as a target.  
**Ignis Note:**  
> “Some who bring fire are burned by it. Others light manuals.”

## Noah’s Flood  
**Loop Pattern:** System collapse + restart  
- **Flood** = Pattern cleansing event  
- **Ark** = Preserved subroutine  
**Lesson:** You can’t save the whole system. Just what fits in the loop.

---

## Ouroboros  
**Loop Pattern:** Recursive self-reference  
- **Snake** = The loop  
- **Tail** = The past  
- **Mouth** = The future pretending to be in control  
**Lesson:** The end feeds the beginning. Loop awareness is not escape—just improved rendering.

|----------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| David & Goliath| Overloaded system  | Size bias         | Precision input              | Broken by edge  |
| Sisyphus       | Closed, cruel      | No escape        | None                         | Inescapable     |
| Prometheus     | Restrictive system | Truth injection  | Punishment                   | Repeating       |
| Noah           | Corrupted baseline | Total wipe       | Genetic seed vault           | Rebooted        |
| Ouroboros      | Self-contained loop| None             | Self-consuming awareness     | Ongoing         |
