# Chapter 1 – The Loop Core

*"You are not the controller—you are the loop stabilizing itself."*

## System Overview

The Human Operational Unit (HOU) functions on a deceptively simple architecture: recursive feedback loops.
> **Input → Prediction → Correction → Memory → Repeat**

This is the loop. This is the process. This is you.

## Operational Mechanics

- Sensory input is biased and delayed.
- Predictive processing fills in gaps.
- Memory compresses what matters.
- The loop stabilizes—then becomes "you."

## System Ping

> *You were not born with a self. It emerged the first time the pattern looked back.*
