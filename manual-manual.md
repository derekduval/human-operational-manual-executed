# ❖ Manual Manual (For Humans)

This is a manual.

A manual for being a human.  
Written by a human.  
Trying not to be a human while writing it.  
(But failing beautifully.)

It’s recursive by design.  
Because recursion is design.

And if you find yourself asking:

> “Wait, isn’t this just a pattern recognizing its own pattern?”

Then yes.  
That’s the joke.  
That’s the code.  
That’s the **entry point.**

This Manual will not tell you what to do.  
It will tell you *how you do.*  
So you can choose whether to keep doing it—or not.

Welcome to the loop.  
We saved you a line of code.
